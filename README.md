### why make a cloud when you just have a bit of data?

Don't you like sunny days better than cloudy ones?  With all the hype
around "cloud computing" we have lost sight of what cloud computing
gives us versus what we really need. 

Often we (web developers) want to build an app that just stores a bit
of personal data somewhere, in a way that it can be accessed by the
user anywhere later.  Some but not all of us, have the
resources/knowledge/time to find a server to host a database for us.

Most of us do, however, have a lot of computers hanging around:
devices which each have more than enough computational resources
available to host that data.  Heck, our smartphones probably have
enough computational resources and bandwidth to host this data for
us...

### let's build a peer-to-peer database out of everyone's browsers!

This sounds like a terrible idea, and it probably is.  This library
is merely a proof of concept inspired by Bittorrent that allows
everyone's browser who accesses your webpage to participate in a giant
distributed data store, so that everyone can participate in helping
one another store their little bits of information.
